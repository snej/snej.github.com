This is the weblog of Jens Alfke.

**Introverted, intuitive, thinking, perceiving.** I live to make things: most often software, sometimes designs or mix-CDs or stories or photos. (I wish I could make music.)

**Father.** Single dad, raising (at the moment) two teenagers.

**Worker, dreamer.** I’m driven by visions of things that could be. I built things at Apple (AppleScript, Stickies, iChat…) and at Google (Chrome) and I'm now at [Couchbase](http://www.couchbase.com/mobile) building tools to let devices share information with each other.
