title: "Multisensory CPU meter"
---
It just occurred to me that my newish MacBook gives me no less than _four_ sensory modalities for detecting high CPU usage:

# The scrolling bar-graphs [one per CPU] of the Activity Monitor icon in the Dock
# The unobtrusive little purring fan that comes on every few seconds after the CPU's been busy for a while
# The extra warmth of the computer against my palms and lap (I won't say it gets "hot"; maybe "toasty".)
...and the number Four sensory modality I just recognized:
# Faint, pleasant scent of warm electronics ("New Computer Smell")

Still missing is taste, and maybe "balance":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_of_balance and "proprioception":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprioception, but I think I don't _want_ my computer using those pathways to communicate with me.
