Yes, I stopped posting to this blog for a long time.

Yes, when I noticed it again I found I was tired of its look and its software.

Yes, I consequently moved it to another engine (actually, back to WordPress) and to "another theme":http://themes.wordpress.net/columns/1-column/929/d3s1gn-4uck-1/, which I "heavily customized":http://mooseyard.com/Jens/.

Yes, there is no guarantee this cycle might not repeat itself again in the future â€¦ but in the meantime, hello again!

(Oh, there's some good news and bad news associated with this.

* The good news: WordPress has comment-spam filtering, so I've re-enabled comments. Make yourselves at home.
* The bad news: The unique IDs of the posts are all different, so news readers will think all of the posts are new. Sorry! This will only happen once, though.)
