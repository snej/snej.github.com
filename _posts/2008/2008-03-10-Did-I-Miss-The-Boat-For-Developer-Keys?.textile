Am I the only one who hasn't yet gotten a response to their iPhone developer program application â€¦ including the precious, precious developer certificate that lets you download apps to an actual iPhone?

I stupidly forgot to apply until Thursday evening (I was too busy trying to download the SDK), so there are probably three billion others ahead of me, and Apple did say they were accepting "limited numbers".

I did get GeekGameBoard running in the simulator today, but it really needs to be on the actual phone, so I can slide the pieces around with my finger.
