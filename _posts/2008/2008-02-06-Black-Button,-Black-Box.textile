I just ran across "Invisible Games":http://invisiblegames.net/, a website of short and enigmatic fictions. One of them, "The Loneliness Engine":http://invisiblegames.net/archives/the-loneliness-engine/, reminds me of my own short-n-enigmatic "We [Had Black Boxes]":http://mooseyard.com/Jens/2003/10/we-had-black-boxes/. No spooky synchronicity or anything, but they seem to belong together somehow ... which itself fits in with the themes of both stories. Neat.
