title: "Beautiful snej soup, yum"
---
I'm fooling around with "*Soup*":http://www.soup.io, a newish micro-blogging service I just discovered. I've never signed up for tumblr or its other clones, but I'm kind of smitten with Soup, so I set up my own:

<b>"beautiful snej soup, yum":http://snej.soup.io </b>

I've got it aggregating stuff from my del.icio.us, flickr and last.fm accounts, as well as this blog. And I'm directly posting some things I've run across today, via its very nice bookmarklet.

Part of the reason I got sucked in is that *Soup has the single best new-user experience I've ever seen on the web.* You just click the "try it" button on the home page, and you get your own soup blog. No signup, no registration, just instant gratification. Then you can slide open the control panel (that slider itself is a beautiful piece of UI), import from your other social sites, and fool with the settings, all in privacy. Only after you're hooked do you need to press the Create button and choose a username and password, whereupon your soup goes live. It's brilliant â€” the web equivalent of the "untitled document" UI introduced in the '70s by the Xerox Star.

Anyway, "*please take a look and join me!*":http://snej.soup.io (It's not obvious from the untitled-blog experience, but Soup has friends and groups like other social networks.)
