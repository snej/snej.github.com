title: "The Ramones Sing iPhone Development"
---
(This is more or less to the tune of "Rock'n'Roll High School":http://youtube.com/watch?v=AE6w4RERMeI, or any other Ramones song for that matter. You have to imagine Joey Ramone singing it. Johnny, you just "switch between C and F every couple of lines":http://www.guitaretab.com/r/ramones/15557.html, got it?)

Well, back in March I got my feelins hurt
When Apple wouldn't gimme no developer cert
The SDK they gave me had a "simulator" â€”
Fooled around with it, then said "see you lator!"

(iPhone, iPhone, iPhone developer)

Don't care about iPhones on my screen
'Cause that's not where I wanna been
I just wanna run on the Device
I just wanna make it look nice

(I wanna be, an iPhone developer)

On Friday all the lucky devs they got paid
But my real cert came in the email today
Got my key set up, my device provisioned
Got my noob questions sent to the cocoa-dev list

(iPhone, iPhone, iPhone developer)

Now I R a l33t iPhone developx0r
Gonna sell my app at the iPhone App Store
I'm gonna price it at 99 cents
In a couple weeks, it'll be payin' my rent!

(L33t, l33t, l33t, l33t iPhone developx0r)

My app's so rad, it's got things to-do
When you go to White Castle it'll get your tip too
Gonna raise it to a buck ninety-nine
When all of you buy it, I'll be doin' fine!

(L33t, l33t, l33t, l33t iPhone developx0r)

Now I finished my app, I put old books in it too,
Plus some Texas Hold'em and a sudoku
It'll even tell you 'bout the stars at night
And a bright white screen makes a bitchen flashlight!

I put it on the store for twenty-nine bucks,
But the reviews are all "D00D, UR APP IS TEH SUX! ! ! !"

(L33t, l33t, l33t, l33t iPhone developx0r...)
