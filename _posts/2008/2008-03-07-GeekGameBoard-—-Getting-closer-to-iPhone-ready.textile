title: "GeekGameBoard â€” Getting closer to iPhone-ready"
tags: [me, games, cocoa, ios]

To encourage development, I've started an open source project based on the *GeekGameBoard* game-development sample code that Apple published last December (which, by a strange coincidence, I wrote.) <strike>I hope to have it ready for iPhone game development soon.</strike> It runs on iPhones, too!

You can browse or download the source code over at "bitbucket.org":http://bitbucket.org/snej/geekgameboard. It's BSD-licensed, and your contributions are of course welcome.

The changes since "Apple's original sample-code release":http://developer.apple.com/samplecode/GeekGameBoard/index.html are:

* It no longer requires garbage collection. I love GC, but it's not supported on the iPhone, where I am _definitely_ planning to use GGB.
* I fixed some memory leaks of CoreGraphics objects.
* I fixed an assertion-failure when kinging a checker.

h2. What Is GeekGameBoard?

GeekGameBoard is a small Objective-C framework for implementing the user interface of a board or card game. Many games can be implemented in less than 150 lines of code.

It also demonstrates generally-useful Core Animation techniques like:
* Hit testing
* Dragging CALayers with the mouse
* Loading images from files and setting them as layer contents
* 3D "card-flip" animations

Framework classes include Bit, Piece, PlayingCard, HexGrid and more. It comes with sample games from Klondike solitaire to Checkers and even Tic-Tac-Toe. It's all ready for you to add AI, network play, new game definitions...

GeekGameBoard runs on Mac OS X 10.5 or later. iPhone support is coming soon.

h2. Pssst! Game Pieces!

<img src="http://interfacelift.com/icons-mac/previews/0330_gingkosicons.jpg" align="right" style="padding-left: 10px;"/>Icon websites like "IconFactory":http://iconfactory.com/freeware, "InterfaceLift":http://interfacelift.com/icons-mac/index.php?sort=date and "DeviantArt":http://browse.deviantart.com/customization/icons/dock/?order=9&startts=1198051200&endts=1198137600 are great places to get artwork for game pieces. (My personal favorite game pieces are "Ginko's Icons":http://interfacelift.com/icons-mac/details.php?id=330, shown on the right.) Just be aware that most icons, even if freeware, require you to get the copyright holder's permission for anything other than personal use.
