title: "â€œCrashing is an appropriate responseâ€"

A bit of cryptography humor, from Peter Gutmann's slideshow "Everything you Never Wanted to Know about PKI but were Forced to Find Out":http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/pkitutorial.pdf ...

_(Warning: This won't make any sense unless you know what things like "PKI", "self-signed certificates" and "revocation" are)_

*CRL Problems (ctd)*
Revoking self-signed certificates is hairy

* Cert revokes itself
* Applications may:
â€“ Accept the CRL as valid and revoke the certificate
â€“ Reject the CRL as invalid since it was signed with a revoked certificate
â€“ Crash
* Computer version of Epimenides paradox â€œAll Cretans are liarsâ€
â€“ Crashing is an appropriate response
