title: "FakeSteved!"
---
I used to think it was the Big Time if I got a link from "Daring Fireball":http://daringfireball.net, but now someone just pointed out to me that the Fake Steve Jobs has "taken note of my post":http://fakesteve.blogspot.com/2008/01/if-youre-going-to-leave-leave-but-dont.html.

So ... what does it mean for my post to be criticized by a fictional construct that embodies a parody of the CEO of the very same ex-employer my post criticizes? Especially when, more specifically, that fictional construct's humor is largely based on an exaggerated _inversion_ of Apple's carefully-groomed non-blogging public image, and he calls out a quote of mine that decries exactly the situation that his (fictional) presence repudiates?

Someone call the Semiotic Crisis Hotline for me! This situation calls for the skills of a "Jean Baudrillard":http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/baudrillard/#4 â€” too many levels of irony for me to parse, man.
