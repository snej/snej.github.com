* I've now "implemented BLIP in Python":http://mooseyard.com/hg/hgwebdir.cgi/MYNetwork/file/tip/Python/. That officially makes it cross-platform! If we get a third implementation, can we call it an "industry standard"?
* There's some "detailed protocol documentation":http://projects.mooseyard.com/wiki/1/Protocol, too.
* Also, on "Steven Frank's recommendation":http://stevenf.com/archive/bug-tracking-decision.php, I set up the "Redmine":http://redmine.org project tracker "on my website":http://projects.mooseyard.com/projects/show/1. It's pretty slick! Kind of "Trac On Rails".
