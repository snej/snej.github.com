title: "That New-Cards Smell"
---
"My Decktet":http://mooseyard.com/Jens/2008/08/i-made-a-decktet/ is a thing of beauty. I even printed & assembled the box (an activity that took me back to my happy childhood days of making paper polyhedra models.)

The only problem is that the cards still have a faint sickly-sweet stink of toluene and acetone (from the plastic coating) even after I left them spread out on the floor for a few days. It's quite unpleasant, not like the nice smell of new books, cars or boardgames.

Is this the papercraft equivalent of "Code Smell":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell?
