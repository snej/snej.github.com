title: "Make Mine Mercurial"

Distributed version-control systems have fascinated me for while. Unlike CVS and Subversion and the like, they don't rely on a central server; instead, any user of the software can host a copy of the repository, and change-sets are pushed between repositories in a peer-to-peer fashion. These are a lot more powerful and flexible -- the centralized CVS model is merely one special case of the configurations that a distributed system can use. And the issues of trust, synchronization and branching that they deal with are very similar to those that appear in peer-to-peer networks.

I've tried out several of these, including "Monotone":http://monotone.ca/ and "Bazaar":http://bazaar-vcs.org/, but lately I've settled on "*Mercurial*":http://selenic.com/mercurial. I find it the simplest to understand and use, and being written in Python it's extremely portable.

Mercurial's having a contest to design a new logo. I hadn't been paying attention, but today I was reminded of Mercury's symbolic connection to "alchemy and the occult":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermetica, and decided to design something incorporating "John Dee's":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dee _Monas Hieroglyphica_, a symbol he designed based on the astrological symbol for Mercury. (I'm not an expert on Dee or on the occult, but I am a fan of John Crowley, who used both John Dee and his symbol in his "_Ã†gypt_ series":http://www.latimes.com/features/books/la-bkw-park7oct07,1,7334437.story?coll=la-books-utilities&ctrack=1&cset=true of novels.)
