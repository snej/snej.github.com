title: "Shiver 2 - A new mix CD"
---
I've just finished a new mix CD. As the name "Shiver 2" implies, it's a sort-of sequel to my 2003 mix "Shiver":/recordings/mub24, with more plucked guitars, tremolo, and glitchy electronics ... but where the first was a summer mix, this is music for winter, when no matter how many logs crackle on the fire, rain and wind wait patiently outside.

(And once again, the beautiful cover is by my daughter Naomi.)
