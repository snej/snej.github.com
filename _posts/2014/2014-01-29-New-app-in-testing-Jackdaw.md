I’m looking for some more beta testers for a font preview/management utility I’m working on. I've been frustrated by not having a good visual way to browse my font library, so I wrote my own. It’s called **Jackdaw**.

If you have a sizable font collection, choose (or just ogle) fonts on a regular basis, are willing and able to send bug reports/crash logs/suggestions, and are running OS X 10.8 or 10.9 ... then you should totally sign up. (Bonus points if you recognize the reason for the app name!) Testers who send useful feedback will get a free license for the finished app.

If you're interested, send me an email at "thought-palace" @ this domain.
