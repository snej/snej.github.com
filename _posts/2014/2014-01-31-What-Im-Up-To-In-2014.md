## Couchbase Lite

(Née TouchDB, née Couchbase Mobile) [Mobile syncable NoSQL database for iOS](http://www.couchbase.com/mobile#lite). My work project in one way or another since I started at Couchbase in mid-2011. I'm still having fun working on it.

## Couchbase Sync Gateway

[The companion piece](https://github.com/couchbase/sync_gateway) -- the glue that lets Couchbase Lite sync with Couchbase Server. It's been challenging and educational and boundary-stretching, and part of me is sick of working on it because the secret is _I'm not a big-data guy._ I've known for years that I like working on apps better than on servers. But this project had to be done, and I think I've done a good job of it and learned a lot.

## Jackdaw

The font preview/management tool I [mentioned](../../29/New-app-in-testing-Jackdaw/) a few days ago. I had an itch so eventually I gave in and scratched it. Hopefully I can get the app wrapped up soon and put it in the App Store -- that'll be a first for me.

## Mixup

Mixup is an audio app I've been working on intermittently since 2005(!) It's gone through several iterations of audio APIs -- QTKit, AudioUnits, now AVFoundation. I use it to make my [mixes](http://recordings.mooseyard.com), but it never gets quite solid enough to think about releasing. Maybe I'll focus on it again soon and fix the latest crop of bugs...

## etc.

* Despite my best efforts I managed to accumulate another piece of unneeded music gear in 2013: a tiny and ultra-cute [Korg Volca](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhh_YMnKuVA) analog synth.
* I've been dinking around with Jekyll and HPSTR and LESS to bring this blog to life.
* I've got a short story in my brain that really needs to be written down. It's been too long since I've done any writing.
* I've made a couple of mixes that aren't up on the website yet; I'll get those uploaded soon.
