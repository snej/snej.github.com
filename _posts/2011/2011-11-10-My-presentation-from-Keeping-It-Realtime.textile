title: "My presentation from Keeping It Realtime"
---
I gave another talk about Couchbase/CouchDB at the "Keeping It Realtime conference":http://krtconf.com this week in Portland. This one is titled <i>"_ch_ch_changes: CouchDB/Couchbase Notifications And Replications"</i>, and "the slides are now up on slideshare":http://www.slideshare.net/Couchbase/keeping-itrealtimechchchanges.

I had a great time. The conference itself was pretty exciting, even if some of the content was over my head (I'm not primarily a web developer, server-side isn't how I roll, and I've only just started learning about node.js this week!) Plus: Portland. OMG, I love Portland.
