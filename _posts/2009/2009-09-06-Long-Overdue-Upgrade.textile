title: "Long-Overdue Upgrade"
---
I finally bit the bullet and upgraded to the latest WordPress from the seriously prehistoric version I used to run (I think it was 2.0.4 or something like that.) With the current attacks against older versions, it finally seemed like a worthwhile thing to waste an afternoon on. :-P

Almost everything should work more or less the same. I've taken the opportunity to move to a subdomain -- jens.mooseyard.com -- but the old URLs redirect. The theme is different, because my hacked-up, customized old theme probably wouldn't have survived the upgrade intact. I can't say I like this one better, but it'll do.
