This is the blog of Jens Alfke.

<strong>Introverted, intuitive, thinking, perceiving.</strong> I live to make things: most often software, sometimes designs or mixes or stories or photos. (I wish I could make music.)

<strong>Father, husband.</strong> My home is a nest of family. Outside is overrun with flowers and vines and shade trees, inside with books and CDs and kids’ drawings and game pieces and game cartridges.

<strong>Worker, dreamer.</strong> I’m driven by visions of things that could be.
