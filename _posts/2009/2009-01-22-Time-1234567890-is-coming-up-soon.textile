In just three weeks the Unix @time_t@ timestamp (the number of seconds since 1 Jan 1970) will hit the crucially important value 1,234,567,890:

<pre>$ python -c 'import time; print time.ctime(1234567890)'
Fri Feb 13 15:31:30 2009</pre>

(That's PST.) Just in time for a geeky Friday-the-13th happy-hour beer bash.
