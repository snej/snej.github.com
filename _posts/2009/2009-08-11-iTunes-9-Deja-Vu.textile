title: "iTunes 9 Deja Vu"

"AppleInsider reports on the iTunes 9 rumors":http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/09/08/11/apple_rumored_to_create_social_media_consolidation_client.html:

bq. "The social networking integration that we reported iTunes 9 would have seems to be part of a bigger social networking push by Apple," the report states. "We’ve been informed that Apple has plans to tie iTunes 9 into a "Social" application that they plan to release in the future."

This sounds like the kind of app (though separate from iTunes) that Jessica Kahn and I kept trying in vain to get Apple to build, circa 2003-2005. Maybe they'll get some use out of our abandoned prototypes.

bq. The report goes on to say that the new application would allow users to share their listening habits with friends [and] send music to friends"

Mike Estee and I had actually prototyped this in iChat in 2003, but the feature never got approved since there were so many more _important_ things to add, like 3-way video conferencing. (Plus the fact that Apple execs turned white as a sheet if you said the words "send music" near them.)

Anyway, personal bitterness aside, I think it's really amusing that Apple keeps shoving the kitchen sink into iTunes, since that has to be the single nastiest, hardest-to-extend codebase they have — it's their last remaining Carbon app, with a foundation that dates back to Casady & Greene's SoundJam, circa 1998.
