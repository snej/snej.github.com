title: "The Dungeon Master"
---
Call the roller of big dice,
The long-haired one, and bid him whip
On kitchen tables consecutive 18's.
Let the fighters dawdle in such armor
As they are used to wear, and let the mages swap
Delicious spells from last month's Dragon.
Let a fumble be finale of its caster:
The only emperor is the dungeon master.

Take from the manual of monsters
Painted with three crude beasts, that sheet
On which I enumerated his stats once,
And spread it so as to cover his face.
If his bag remains, rifle his hoard
To see who gets his precious +6 sword.
Light the lamp to run away faster.
The only emperor is the dungeon master.
