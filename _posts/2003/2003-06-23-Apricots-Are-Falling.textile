title: "Apricots Are Falling"
---
<font size="+1">
The apricots are falling, bit by bit
helped along by interfering squirrels.
Though not yet ripe, they roll upon the bricks,
all with tooth-marks, some with chewed-up pits.
This fruit debacle ï¬lls us with dismay,
as we had hoped the ripe fruit to preserve
and so retain the sweetness of the day
In far December when lightâ€™s gone away.</font>
