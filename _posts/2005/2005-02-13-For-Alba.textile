<p><font size="+1">
Not pink yet, she: bloody red.
Not one to be held back, she, even by the host's noose,
even by constraints of brute geometry.
Her universe distended, tore and bled for her.</font></p><p><font size="+1">Thus the advent of the smallest unstoppable force:
wee Alba hurled through the plate glass into life,
now fixes us with a blue gaze,
her raised arms encompassing it all,
and says â€œI am an old soul. I'm back now.â€</font></p>
