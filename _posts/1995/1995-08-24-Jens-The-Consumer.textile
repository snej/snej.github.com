bq. The problem of leisure
What to do for pleasure
Ideal love a new purchase
A market of the senses
--Gang Of Four, â€œNatural's Not In Itâ€

bq. â€œHe realizes everything he does is second-hand, a waking dream,  a dream someone else has dreamed for him -- when he walks into  a pub and greets friends with a line he's half-consciously  lifted from last night's sit-com, he's an advertisement. He  hears himself and he feels tricked, humiliated, so he smashes  into his friends ... as if he's never seen them before but  knows they mean him no good. Screaming, he insists that he's happy.â€
--Greil Marcus

Like most of us, I derive much of my sense of identity from mass-marketed consumer commodities, and present my identity to other people by prominently displaying these brand names and logos. But it's okay, because I adopt a knowing, ironic Generation-X attitude towards it.

And really, apart from Apple t-shirts (they give them to me for free) and other shirts so deeply ironic they can't be taken seriously (Spam, Mister Bubble) the major brand names I freely advertise are those of musical groups that haven't quite taken over the world yet. Many of them aren't even signed to deals with multinational corporations. Yet I have bought so deeply into the pop music dream that I believe the names and identities of my favorite bands are indicative of who I am and what I stand for.
